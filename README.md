5 min talk+slides about proposed pedagogical benefit to making students see and use the debugger as soon as possible

# Outline

- Debugging can be useful at a high level
- Initial hurdle
    - easy to miss at university courses
        - fast moving courses
            - programming as a tool
            - 
        - resetting expectations anecdote: high school
            - starting period was much slower
            - teacher quote ("students usually find programming very hard at the beginning,... until something clicks"?)
        - remind: starting programming is hard -
        - people who fall behind before the "click" still exist
            - many ways for students to be ahead in intro courses
                - scratch
                - online programming tutorials very accessible
                - multiple opportunities for intro courses
            - anecdotal experience tutoring: people still having trouble with basic concepts in week 2-3
        - remind: people finding programming hard, exist, even at university -
- Teaching methods for getting over this:
    - Just saying "program runs line-by-line" somehow isn't enough
        - needs to be internalised
        - find ways to be convince
    - *find excerpt from textbook with on-paper line-by-line stepthrough of program*
    - debugger demo/screenshots
        - same as textbook but more convincing
        - side-effect of introducing students to own use later
